# Ansible Playbook Boilerplate Directory

OJ Tibi <[ojtibi@gmail.com](mailto:ojtibi@gmail.com)>

Ansible is an open-source software platform for configuring and managing computers. It combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and configuration management. It manages nodes over SSH and requires Python (2.4 or later) to be installed on them.

I made this repository in hopes that it will be useful to those who want
to start an Ansible playbook with the recommended directory layout
described at the [Ansible Documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html)

## Installation

Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/ojtibi/ansible-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) and extract to a directory where you want to work with your project. Alternatively, you can do a `git clone` + `git archive`, but I think downloading is easier.
